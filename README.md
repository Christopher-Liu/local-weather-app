# Local Weather App

Single page web application that takes the user's geolocation and displays both the local weather conditions as well as a 3-day forecast. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Originally made as my submission for a frontend development project for the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

## Prerequisites
Nothing extra needs to be done/installed from the user. Note that if you are using an adblocker or something else that disables JavaScript on web pages, they might interfere with the AJAX requests.
